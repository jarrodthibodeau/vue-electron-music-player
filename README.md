# vue-electron-music-player

> This is based off @christiannwamba's series of tutorials on Scotch.io. I figured it would be nice to recreate this using VueJS

> [Angular example](https://github.com/christiannwamba/scotch-ng-music-player)

> [React example](https://github.com/christiannwamba/scotch-player)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080 (non-electron)
npm run dev

# server with hot reload for electron 
npm run electron

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# builds for production and runs it in electron (MUST BE SERVERD VIA HTTP SERVER)
npm run electron-prod

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

This was built using vue-cli :)
